# Breast Cancer Classification
In this project, I have used the following classification techniques for breast cancer classification -
1) Linear Regression
2) Artificial Neural Networks
3) Decision Tree Classifier
4) Bagging Classifier
5) Random Forest Classifier
6) AdaBoost Classifier
7) GradientBoost Classifier

Dataset used - Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)</b> (Wolberg, W. H., Street, W. N., & Mangasarian, O. L. (1994). UCI Machine Learning Repository. https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic))

Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.
